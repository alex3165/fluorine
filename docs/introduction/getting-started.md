# Getting Started

It doesn't take much to get started with Fluorine in your React project.
All it takes is installing it with the necessary peer dependencies:

```sh
npm install --save fluorine-lib react rxjs
```

React and RxJS 5 are peer dependencies for **Fluorine**. They're not
direct dependencies so they don't interfer with your requirements
to these two packages.

The next part in the introduction is on how to structure your React
project: [Structure](structure.md). It will help you to set up some
basic things in your React project.
